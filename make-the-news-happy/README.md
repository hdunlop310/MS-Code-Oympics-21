This program attempts to read in the guardian's headlines, scan each word in each headline to see if it is positive and negative and tries to change the negative word to a positive one. The program successfully reads in the headlines. The program then scans each word in a given headline, and uses Monkey Learn's sentiment analysis API to determine whether a given word is positive or negative. If a word is classed as negative, the program uses nltk's wordnet antonyms function to find the opposite of that word (thus changing it to a positive word). However the program doesn't quite word as expected, the negative_to_positive function doesn't always return the antonym as expected, and I couldn't word out why. I thought I should submit what I have anyway.

In order to run the program, you will need a Monkey Learn API key which you can get [here.](https://monkeylearn.com/signup/) You should then paste your key in the marked area on line 39.
